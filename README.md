# Description

 ## Swapcase.
This function accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. 
<br />For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

## Array Generator
This function accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. 
<br />For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## Prime Number Seive.
This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. 
<br />It identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array.
<br />For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
